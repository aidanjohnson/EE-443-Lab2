# EE 443 Lab 2

## Problem 1
Status: Complete

Complete:
- generates echo effect (using textbook code)

Incomplete:
- confirmation of buffer delay 

## Problem 2
Status: Complete

Complete:
- Flips input data set
- Tested with [0:1:511] input -> [511:-1:0] output

Incomplete:
- N/A

## Problem 3
Status: In Progress

Complete:
- Assembly code that correctly computes based on algorithm of: For each correlation coefficient k, sum the product of the input function x(n) and it shifted by k x(n+k) for n between [0,N-k], where N is the number of samples of x(n).


Incomplete:
- Functioning autocorrelation assembly code
- Multiplication seems to be incorrect when compared to Scilab correlation
